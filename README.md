# Description
  How to play:
  1. Find the Ace of Spades after the cards are shuffled.
  2. If you find the Ace of Spades, you win.
  3. If you don't, then you lose and you have to try again. 
# Explanation of Technologies
  The technologies and or resources I mostly used were W3School, MDN, YouTube and a little bit of github. I also used
  some of the homework assignments and past projects I've done as reference.
# Approach Taken
  The approach I took was first looking at examples of other 3 card monte games online and researching how they worked. Then I set up my HTML page following
  my wireframe layout. Then I set up my CSS and then I went into Javascript and started writing my functions.
# Unsolved Problems
  Currently two unsolved problems. 
     The first problem is I can't shuffle the array of images randomly. 
     The second problem is I wasn't able to replay the game after a win/loss state.
