# Explanation of Technologies
  The technologies and or resources I mostly used were W3School, MDN, YouTube and a little bit of github. I also used
  some of the homework assignments and past projects I've done as reference.
# Approach Taken
  The approach I took was first looking at examples of other 3 card monte games online and researching how they worked. Then I set up my HTML page following
  my wireframe layout. Then I set up my CSS and then I went into Javascript and started writing my functions.
# Unsolved Problems
  Currently two unsolved problems. 
     The first problem is I can't shuffle the array of images randomly. 
     The second problem is I wasn't able to replay the game after a win/loss state.
